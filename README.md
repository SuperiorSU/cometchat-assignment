# 🚀 Internship Assignment - CometChat

This project is a modern React-based frontend web application, built using the Vite bundler. 

The application was developed as part of the internship selection assignment for **CometChat**, showcasing clean architecture, reusable components, responsive design, and smooth scroll-based animations.

It uses several modern libraries including:

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **React Router DOM** for routing
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** for scroll-based animations
- **React Icons** for scalable vector icons
- **React Fast Marquee** for animated marquee components
